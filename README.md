Car Rental Service - Backend

This backend service is designed for a car rental company, structured around Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The core domain logic is fully decoupled from infrastructure and application layers, ensuring flexibility and ease of maintenance. The project includes:

- Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers clearly separated.
- Unit and functional tests covering business logic and service behavior.
- Infrastructure implementations with MongoDb.

The system is ready for production use, supporting future scalability and integration with external services.
